----------------------------------------


1. Installation

   Needs Sylpheed-Claws 0.7.0claws59 or later.

   a. User installation:

      cd ~/.sylpheed/themes 
      gzip -dc Graphitte.tar.gz | tar xf -

   b. System wide installation:

      as root:

      cd $SYLPHEED_PREFIX/share/sylpheed/themes
      gzip -dc Graphitte.tar.gz | tar xf -

      where $SYLPHEED_PREFIX is the prefix used when configuring Sylpheed
      (usually /usr/local or /usr).

    After installation, run sylpheed and search for the Pixmap theme
    option somewhere in <Configuration/Common Preferences>.


2. Notes and copyrights

   This theme was made mainly from scratch, which I put in public domain, 
   except the addressbook icon which is based on the original one, and has
   its same license. 
   Other icons are the originals included with Sylpheed Claws and have
   the original license and copyrights.
   README file style/contents borrowed from Melvin Hadasht's XeNtish theme.
